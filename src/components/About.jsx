        create meaningful applications.</p>
      <p>
        My experience in civil engineering has instilled in me a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills, all of which are transferable to 
        software development. I am currently honing my skills in web development, learning modern technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.
